# Python Projects
##matrix.py##

I created this project to use computing power to calculate determinant, cofactors, and matrix multiplication quickly.

I used recursion for calculation of determinant of nth order matrix.

My program is Order Independent.

##OptimizedPrimeGen.py##

I used the fact that any prime number greater than 3 can be written in form of 6m +- 1
where m is any Natural Number.

I stopped checking for multiples at square root of the number.

Limiting range of lower and upper bound is 50,000 for numbers in range of 9Billion. (for best performance)
